# pizza-time
One evening during [URY Candidate Interview night...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXYyp7FCvSI)

Some person: "Qumarth, we've just ordered lots of pizza and it's going to turn up in an hour. Can you make a big countdown timer that we can put on the big screen?"

Me: "Sure!"

30 minutes later, the pizza arrived and this project was abandoned **until now!** This is complete rebuild using AngularJS, so I can learn AngularJS
